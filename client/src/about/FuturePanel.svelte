    <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    
    <p>I currently want to pursue a Doctorate in computer science. Specifically, I want to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical computing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory">algorithmic information theory</a>. I don't want to just use computers; I want to study the limit of what is computationally possible.</p>

    <p>After I earn my degree, I've been thinking about becoming a professor. I've always enjoyed teaching others. Also, being a professor will let me conduct my own research free from financial incentives. However, this plan is subject to changeâ€”many things can happen in 6 years!</p>

    <p>I am currently in the process of applying colleges (odds are you're probably an admission officer). Because of that, my future is uncertain.

        Still, I remain excited to encounter what's next.
